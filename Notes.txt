Organization:
  A workspace contains computations
  A computation consists of one or more statements separated by comparators.
  Two statements not separated by comparators are considered to be two separate computations.
  A statement consists of numbers, operations, and comments
  Numbers can be positive or negative and can optionally have prefix or suffix units.
    If units are incompatible, they will simply not combine-no error will result
      Units could be converted into comments if incompatible, or the expression could remain symbolic
    Prefix units include $,â‚¬, etc...
    Suffix units include the SI and Imperial system as well as currencies
      Suffix units can be abbreviated, but they will automatically expand as soon as their meaning can be inferred.
  Operators can be unary or binary
    Binary operators can be +, -, /, *, %, mod, in (when the next element is a unit)
  Comparators can be =, <, >, <=, >=
  Comments can come between numbers and operators without changing the interpretation of a computation

Computations can reference other computations by linking two numbers together.
ctrl-clicking on a number will unlock it
cmd-clicking (on OSX) and shift-clicking (on Windows) on a number adds it to the current selection
ctrl-clicking on an element that is part of the current selection will unlock and link all of those numbers
You can also drag link two numbers as shown in Bret Victor's video
Undo will undo typing as normal.
Scrubbing can be reverted with one undo rather than an undo per update of the scrub.
Double-click on a portion of a computation selects that portion. Triple-click on a part of a computation selects the whole computation. Quadruple click selects every computation in the workspace.
Click and drag inside a number to scrub. No modifier needs to be held down. Click and dragging from the left or right of the number will result in a selection instead. Numbers will be big enough such that this isn't a problem.
