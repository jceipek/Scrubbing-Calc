Some experiments with calculation inspired by 
[Bret Victor's Scrubbing Calculator concept](http://worrydream.com/#!/ScrubbingCalculator)

The calculator can currently be used like a standard numeric calculator with scrubbing. 
However, it doesn't allow editing existing equations and has some odd bugs.
